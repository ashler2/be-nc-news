## Test Output

Read through all errors. Note that any failing test could be caused by a problem uncovered in a previous test on the same endpoint.

<!--
### PATCH `/api/articles`

Assertion: expected 404 to equal 405

- use `.all()` on each route, to serve a 405: Method Not Found status code -->

<!--
### GET `/api/articles/1`

Assertion: expected { Object (articles) } to contain key 'article'

- send the article to the client in an object, with a key of `article`: `{ article: {} }`
- return the single article in an object, not in an array -->

### GET `/api/articles/1`

Assertion: Cannot read property 'comment_count' of undefined

Assertion: expected { Object (update) } to contain key 'article'

- send the updated article with a key of `article` -->

### PATCH `/api/articles/1`

Assertion: expected 400 to equal 200

- ignore a `patch` request with no information in the request body, and send the unchanged article to the client
- provide a default argument of `0` to the `increment` method, otherwise it will automatically increment by 1

## GENERAL

- personally wouldn't bother parsing each comment_count, would just leave it for the front end. If you you wanted to do this, extract it out as a util function and test it.
- few typos in names of functions etc. eg. destoryComment
- would expect to see getComments to be in the comments model <- you have a few in articles which I'd expect in
- _articlesController_ - I would spread your params and queries into the functions and take them out as parameters in the model.
- _migrations_

```js
usersTable
  .string("username")
  .unique("username") //argument not needed
  .primary()
  .notNullable();
```

- _errors_ - You're not invoking `next` in your `sendCustomError` function so errors500 will never be called.
- no 405 handler in on `/api/articles/` path
- _commentsController_ - I wouldn't bother passing deletedComments to the then block as you're not using it.
- you can refactor your patchVotes. Incrementing by a negative number is the same as decrementing üëç
- _destoryComment_ - you have a then block which isn't doing anything. You should deal with your 404 error here.
- _getTopics_ - model is doing half the job for the controller!
